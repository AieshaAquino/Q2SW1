<b>(Pugs are frequently described using the Latin phrase multum in parvo, which means "much in little." Why? Because this charming, playful, people-loving breed packs a lot of dog into a small package. Pugs are expressive, funny, devoted, and loving. Knowing a Pug is to love one.)</b>

 <table border="1">
<h4 style="background color:#376A91  ;">2.) Poodle</h4>
<th colspan="5"><img src="poodle.jpeg" width="25%" height="25%">
     <b>(Poodles are among the most easily recognized of all dog breeds. Known primarily for their fashionable appearance, the athletic, eager, and intelligent Poodle possesses far more abilities than simply being attractive.)</b>

    <th colspan="5"><img src="GR.jpeg" width="25%" height="25%">
    	<b>(From hunting and tracking to rescue and service dog work, Golden Retrievers are used for it all. Despite their playful, sometimes goofy demeanor, they learn quickly and can master a wide range of skills, including performing as search and rescue dogs at disaster sites.)</b>

<h4 style="background color:#62839B; ">7.)Pekingese</h4>
<th colspan="5"><img src="PG.jpeg" width="25%" height="25%">
	<b>(Pekingese owners frequently characterize their pets as "opinionated," which may be due to their royal heritage: these dogs are clever, know their own minds, and aren't hesitant to express their emotions. Obedience courses are a wonderful approach to ensure that these lion-like abilities do not manifest as intransigence.)</b>

<h4 style="background color:#62839B; ">8.)ChowChow</h4>
<th colspan="5"><img src="Chow.jpeg" width="25%" height="25%">
      <b>(Chow chow is derived from a pidgin-English phrase used in the 18th century to designate anything originating from the East. These fluffy puppies were used as working dogs in China, where they were trained to hunt, protect, pull sleds, and even herd cattle.)</b>

<h4 style="background color:#62839B; ">9.)Dalmatian</h4>
<th colspan="5"><img src="Dalmatian.jpeg" width="25%" height="25%">
	<b>(Dalmatians were sentinels along the borders of Dalmatia and Croatia during wartime. They've also worked with herding, ratting, and hunting dogs. The Dalmatian is also the only dog breed that was bred for "coaching," which involves racing behind a stagecoach and moving crowds out of the way so the horses may pass.)</b>

<table border="1">
<h4 style="background color:#62839B; ">10.)Shiba Inu</h4>
<th colspan="5"><img src="SI.jpeg" width="25%" height="25%">
<b>(Shibas have been utilized for both small and large game hunting. Because they are tiny, they are effective at flushing birds and other small wildlife from shrubs. Shibas are tough canines that have survived for thousands of years in Japan's hilly regions.)</b>
